summary: A computer keyboard designed and manufactured from scratch.

Original idea was spawned when going through the scrap bin in the laser cutting room. I found a slab of quarter inch thick acrylic and had a dream to be able to have a keyboard that, instead of the normal RGB under the keys, had an underglow. I got to work designing a keyboard that would fit inside the size acrylic I had and I settled onto 10 keyless design that I could laser cut out of a combination of birch wood and the acrylic.

After assembling the case I had the PCB printed with the help of LFKeyboards.

Then I selected the keys that I wanted and began to hand solder the PCB including all 107 keys.

After installing the frimware, [QMK](https://qmk.fm/), the keyboard was ready to be tested.

After confiming all the keys work and the backlight and underglow work I was able to install the keycaps and call it complete.
