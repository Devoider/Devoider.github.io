<p> Built from the ground up with 2 specific purposes: Speed and Stability.
Able to fly at 80+ mph for upto 15 minutes the drone is ideal for videography requiring fast moving objects. </p>

<p>Design is picked from comercial off the shelf components, mostly from [Pyro Drone.](https://pyrodrone.com/) Those components were then assembled by me.</p>
