## Managers Perspective
My software experience is very minimally hands-on. Most of my experience, outside of classes, in the Software realm has been from the perspective of a chief engineer on the UH drone technologies team. I was in charge of getting everything involved in the design of a UAV to combine into the final product with minimal problems. This is generally summed up under the broad term of "Integration." This included everything from the physical manufacturing and the mechanical aspect to PCB assembly.


## Integration of Software
Because of this, most of my software experiance is in integrating software into a larger system. One of these integrations is an autonomous object detection, classification and localization algorithm that needs to identify objects on the ground from the air and then tell the user where and what they are. This is being used for search and rescue purposes. As the chief engineer my job consisted of mostly getting all of the various modules of the software integrated into a final whole that could get the final job done.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
