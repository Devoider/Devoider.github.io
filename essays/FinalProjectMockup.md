## Overview
The problem: We are currently in uncharted territory in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is time-consuming and difficult to stay informed. There are a plethora of resources to keep track of, some of it better then others. With new information coming out every day, being informed and aware is essential to staying healthy and responsible.

The solution: The _____ application provides up to date information on COVID-19 in different categories. The user can view information regarding all of the US, such as government policies, symptoms, and preventative measures. There is also a section of information specific to Hawaii; including the number of people affected, how many hospital beds are available, and a community section for users to write tips about where to find toilet paper.

## Approach
There are three different levels of access. No special access is required to view information posted on the countrywide sections. User is the second level access; it is required to view statewide information (Due to your account being tied to the state) and post in the community section and suggest information to be posted, users must make an account and provide general information about themselves.  Admin is the third level access; it is required to moderate and update the information posted, admins do not need to create an account, their accounts are already created.
Mock up pages include:

-General Landing page

-General Country specific page

-User Card page (where the user sees the states they have selected/subscribed)

-User State Specific page

-General Sign up page

-User Edit page (edit what states the user Selected/Subscribed too)

-General Sign-in page

-User Community page

-Admin Edit page/s

## Use Case Ideas
A new user goes to the landing page, views US information, goes to sign up page, makes an account, gets landing page, goes to state cards page, goes to  state page, goes to the community page, makes a community post.
Admin goes to the landing page, goes to sign-in page,  goes to edit page, adds information, changes existing information, 
Beyond the Basics
Everything above is stuff we have done previously, with the exception of collecting, analysing and displaying data from users and data from external sources. It would be especially powerful to have a place that accessed the state specific reporting and displayed it rather than having to jump around looking for just the states I am specifically looking for. At the moment there are places that display all states/counties or state/county specific numbers. 
This project may be too complex for our current ability, however it is very modular. Implementation of individual pieces, working up to our capability, is a possibility with a project structured as this one is.
