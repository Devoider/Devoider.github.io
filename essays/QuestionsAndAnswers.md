## Skillful Asking
Question on [Stack Exchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23259168/what-are-express-json-and-express-urlencoded)
#### "What are express.json() and express.urlencoded()?"
"I cannot find any documentation on express.json() and express.urlencoded(). What do each of them do exactly?"

### Simple and Sweet
This asker has made it clear from the title what they are looking for. The title contains exactly what the asker is looking for without any fluff surrounding it. 

The body of the question helps to ease any responder with inhibitions about a question this simple by clarifying that they cannot find the documentation, simultaniously showing the responder they they have tried to find an answer and the place where the answer should be found was not viable.

This results in several answers explaining the difference, but more pertinently this resulted in a very thoughtful person explaining where the answer could be found in the documentation despite its reletively unintuitive location. This is the kind of answer he is looking for. 

## Bad Questions get Sassy Answers
Question on [Stack Exchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35251188/generate-a-random-file-of-0s-and-1s)
#### "Generate a random file of 0's and 1's"
"I would like to generate a random file of size 2MB which consists only of 0's and 1's in either Linux/Windows for one of my projects. I tried this command in Linux:
```bash
$ time dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/null bs=1M count=2
```
but urandom only takes random data from the kernel and just copies to the file which is not what I need. Any ideas regarding this?"

### So Whats Wrong?
There are lots wrong with this question. First, the title: though succinct, there is not enough information to really know what the asker needs. The seedling of a question is there, but not enough for people to actually click into the question. 

The asker has given very little for the responders to work with. The single attempt to find the answer elsewhre doesnt help the asker's case. The responders took note of this and most of the responses contain phrases such as "Can you edit your question and decide what do you want?" and "What do you ACTUALLY need?" This is more then understandable. 

There are some valid answers and responses but they are rushed, inefficient and unthoughtful. This is the deserved response for a question like this. The Asker was rude and unthoughtful in his question and recieved same in response.
