## Skillful Asking
My software experience is very minimally hands-on. Most of my experience, outside of classes, in the Software realm has been from the perspective of a chief engineer on the UH drone technologies team. I was in charge of getting everything involved in the design of a UAV to combine into the final product with minimal problems. This is generally summed up under the broad term of "Integration." This included everything from the physical manufacturing and the mechanical aspect to PCB assembly.
