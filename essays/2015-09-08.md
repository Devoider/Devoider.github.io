## Javascript?

I'd never touched Javascript, not even touched java before this class and through this first week of class I've learned a lot about Javascript. It is a brilliant abomonation of a programming language and over my less then a week of using it I have been both frustrated and in awe of what it is capable
## What blew my mind. &#128165;
I have been deeply ingrained into the C programing language from the beggining of the engineering program. I came to school with almost no prior serious programming experience and so I can really only claim proficiency in C. So the first time I had a function create its own function and the first time I had a variable change its type my mind was sufficiently blown. Most of my preconceived notions about programming were shattered. The limitations of C were nothing when compared to the beautiful simplicity of javascripts looseness. 

## Danger of Simplicity

The trick with simplicity and the absence of limitations is that often the limitations are in there for a reason. I recently tried to make sure an array was empty and thinking I was being tricky I used:
'''js
if([] == ![]){
  ...
'''
instead of something more logical, like :
'''js
if(arr.length==0){
...
'''
So, aparently
'''js
if([] == ![]){
  ...
'''
returns true. I spent ages trying to trouble shoot this and infact it was causing an infinite loop. Because of a quirk in JSfiddle
